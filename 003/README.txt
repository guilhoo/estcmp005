We were asked to do the following programs in C, C ++ and Assembly (Nasm) languages:

atv01 - Make a program that receives two whole numbers and generates all numbers that are between them.


atv02 - Make a program that asks for two numbers and prints the largest one.


atv03 - Make a program that asks for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, transform and show the temperature in degrees Celsius.

	mathematical formula:	C = 5 * ((F-32) / 9)


atv04 - Make a program that generate the average grade of the university to pass a subject.

	mathematical formula:	(AP1+AP2)/2	(formula 1. without final teste, needs to be >= 8 to pass)

				(((AP1+AP2)/2)*2+PF)/3		(formula 2. with final teste, needs to be >= 6 to pass)
